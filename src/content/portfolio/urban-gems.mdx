## Overview
Urban Gems is an app that suggests destinations within walking distance to encourage exploration and reduce information overload. 

This case study shows the design process for a group project from conception to high-fidelity prototype.

## Problem
- Residents want to know their neighborhood and discover new places, but information overload leads to analysis paralysis.
- Local businesses are recovering from the pandemic and need support to attract new customers.
- Cities want to encourage residents and visitors to support local businesses and engage with the community.

## Solution
Urban Gems helps users explore their community by recommending destinations from our partnerships with local businesses and city departments.

{/* <CardGroup /> */}

### Discover Hidden Gems
Users can discover attractions within walking distance. Broad categories on the map view encourage exploration while the Hidden Gem pages provide more detail.

### Control Serendipity
Users can choose “don’t suggest gems like this" to personalize their recommendations and continue prioritizing novel experiences.

### Collect Experiences
Users can customize memories on their collections page with photos and text. Memories are displayed like a travel journal with instant film photos and a handwriting font.

## Understanding the Problem
Key insights from user research:

- People want to know about events, not just locations.
- Long-time locals have less motivation to explore than new residents.
- Walking provides more opportunities for serendipity than driving.
- People want trustworthy recommendations that don't feel like ads.
- Information overload leads to analysis paralysis.

Interviews
We conducted 4 unstructured interviews with a convenience sample of personal connections. Our goal was to understand:

The experience of exploring a local neighborhood.
The frustrations and challenges of exploration.
The feeling of serendipity while exploring.

{/* END SHOW MORE */}

## Business Opportunity
We created a lean canvas to consider the business opportunities and context for our solution.

{/* <Media src={leanCanvas.src} alt="Lean canvas" /> */}

## Who are we designing for?
We based our primary persona on the findings from our user interviews and created a secondary persona to represent the local business owner stakeholder's needs.

### FOMO Fred
Core needs
- Discover new things to do around the city.
- Break away from routine and ‘influencer-led’ choices.
- Support local businesses in his city.

### Startup Stella
Core needs
- Gain more customers at the cafe.
- Compete with popular cafes in the area.
- Generate more revenue with minimal upfront costs.

{/* SHOW MORE */}
We identified the need for a secondary persona to represent a business owner of a destination that could be recommended in our solution.

Due to the time constraints of the course project, we did not conduct user interviews of small business owners. We conducted a literature review to identify the needs of small business owners.

## Designing a Delightful Experience
### Sketching Early Ideas

### Initial prototype
{/* card gallery: 8 initial prototype images */}

## Testing in the Wild
{/* tesing card image 1 */}
Users used a phone with the Figma prototype and tested near locations in the prototype.
{/* testing card image 2 */}
I acted as audio navigation and guided users to their selected hidden gem.
{/* testing card image 3 */}
Users were prompted to use the capture a memory feature when they arrived.

### Round 1
Our first round of testing focused on the overall experience of the app (pictured above). User feedback was incorporated in the next prototype iteration before more testing.

### Rounds 2 & 3
The next rounds of testing focused on the interactions within the app and did not include the full experience of walking to destinations.

With more time, we would have used the first round testing procedure to test our final prototype in context of use.

## Major Design interactions
Three design iterations based on user testing are highlighted below.

### Gems Near Memories
{/* before card image */}
Before: Unclear locations
Users wanted to see high-level information about the type of nearby gem without clicking on it.
{/* after card image */}
After: Categorized locations
We added broad categories and an icon to indicate the type of destination. This helped users feel informed while preserving spontaneity.

### Hidden Gem Details
{/* before card image */}
Before: Inefficient information
Users were confused about the “click to see more info” button. It took two clicks to get from the map view to the details page.
{/* after card image */}
After: Information hub
We added a scrollable details card to the preview page. Users could see an overview and read more on a single screen.

### My Collections
{/* before card image */}
Before: Simple delight
Users expressed the most delight in the 'My Collections' page, but it was the least developed idea. One user said, 'I'd want to collect all the gems!'
{/* after card image */}
After: Developed delight
We added customization options and leaned into our theme by styling the elements to resemble a travel journal.
